# README #

This README covers my TSE M2 Thesis on Options Portfolio Optimization.

* Developed a portfolio optimization model of S&P500 options using a GARCH volatility prediction model and the CXVPY package with MOSEK in Python. 
* Collected, processed, and analyzed options, stock, and treasury bill time series data using Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Statsmodels Python packages. 
* Analyzed how pricing and liquidity dynamics in the option markets affected the performance of the optimization model, including with Covid anomalies.
